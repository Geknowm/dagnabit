== 2.2.3 2010-02-17

=== Bugfixes

* It was not possible to delete links having custom data attributes in dagnabit
  versions <= 2.3.2.  This has been fixed.

== 2.2.2 2010-02-04

=== Minor enhancements

* Slightly smarter transitive closure maintenance: if a link was saved but
  neither its ancestor nor descendant changed, the transitive closure will not
  be recalculated.
* Removed usage of deprecated "require 'activesupport'".

== 2.2.1 2009-12-07

=== Minor enhancements

* Added NUBIC provenance.

== 2.2.0 2009-09-14

=== Minor enhancements

* Commonized models used in dagnabit's tests.
* Switched to named scopes to implement Link#linking and TransitiveClosureLink#linking.

== 2.1.0 2009-09-04

=== Bugfixes

* Fixed overzealous on-destroy transitive closure maintenance in situations like these:

    n1 -> n2 -> n3
     |__________|

  Previously, deleting the edges (n1, n2) and (n2, n3) would also delete the
  edge (n1, n3).

== 2.0.0 2009-08-17

=== Major changes

* Link models now validate their ancestor and descendant.  This means that
  Link#connect will fail if a link cannot be made due to node validation
  failures.

  Unfortunately, this also means you can no longer write code like this:

    node1.links_as_parent.build(:descendant => node2)

  or

    node2.links_as_child.build(:ancestor => node1)

  See commit 61d6e3841b63fdcaad7fcecd05b24f4b9f217ba2 for more details.
